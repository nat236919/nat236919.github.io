As this will be the very first rollout of the vaccine, there are still some doubts towards the safety of the vaccine. However, I am confident that the vaccine will be safe and effective; therefore I decided to register to receive my first dose on 23-Aug-2020.
I will keep updating this log as I receive more information before and after receiving my doses.</description></item></channel></rss>
