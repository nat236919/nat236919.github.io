GitHub-Copilot is basically a smart code autocomplete powered by Codex, the new AI system created by OpenAI. GitHub Copilot understands significantly more context than most code assistants. So, whether it&amp;rsquo;s in a docstring, comment, function name, or the code itself, GitHub Copilot uses the context you&amp;rsquo;ve provided and synthesizes code to match.
I received an invitation to test out GitHub Copilot during its technical preview a couple of weeks ago, and I have been using it on Visual Studio Code ever since.</description></item></channel></rss>
