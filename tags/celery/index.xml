Sometimes, tasks like sending emails, processing reports, or running machine learning models need to be offloaded from the main API to avoid slowing down user interactions. This is where the FastAPI + Redis + Celery + Flower stack comes inâ€”a powerful setup that enables asynchronous processing and real-time monitoring of background tasks.
This article will walk you through how these technologies work together and provide a guide for building your own high-performance backend using this stack.</description></item></channel></rss>
