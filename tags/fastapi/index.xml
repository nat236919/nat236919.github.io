Inspiration I wanted to create an easy-to-use web application to practice my skills. Furthermore, I would like to evaluate myself to see how I grow as a person, and to examine the highlights of my journey.
This project uses Vue.js for the UI, and FastAPI for the API which are hosted separately.</description></item><item><title>Introducing FastAPI</title><link>https://nuttaphat.com/posts/2021/06/introducing-fastapi/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 14:36:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://nuttaphat.com/posts/2021/06/introducing-fastapi/</guid><description>Introduction Developing APIs can be painful if we don&amp;rsquo;t know where to start.

FastAPI FastAPI is a high-performace web framework for creating APIs with Python.</description></item></channel></rss>
