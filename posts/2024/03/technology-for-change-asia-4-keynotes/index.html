I had an opportunity to participate in this event for inspiring two days. Here&rsquo;s the summary of each session.</p><h2 id=keynote-interview-building-trust-and-creating-disruption-through-technological-innovation>Keynote interview. Building trust and creating disruption through technological innovation</h2><p><strong>Description</strong>: Named a &ldquo;web celeb&rdquo; by Forbes, Jimmy Wales is best known as the founder of Wikipedia, a collaborative free encyclopaedia, and the Wikimedia Foundation, a charitable organisation dedicated to encouraging the growth, development and distribution of free, multilingual content. Mr Wales will delve into his journey through the world of technology, covering themes including AI, automation and disruptive technological innovation ().</p><p><img alt=keynote1 src=https://i.ibb.co/y8S6YYD/IMG20240227094035.jpg></p><p>The keynote address promises to offer insights into Wales&rsquo; experiences navigating the ever-evolving landscape of technology, shedding light on his perspectives regarding artificial intelligence (AI), automation, and disruptive technological innovation. Furthermore, the discussion will likely explore the intersection of these themes with the mission and evolution of Wikipedia and the Wikimedia Foundation.</p><p>During the interview, particular emphasis will be placed on understanding the impact of Generative AI on platforms like Wikipedia. Generative AI, a branch of artificial intelligence focused on creating content autonomously, has presented both opportunities and challenges for platforms reliant on user-generated content. As an integral part of the discussion, Mr. Wales provided valuable insights into how Wikipedia has adapted to and navigated the implications of Generative AI within its ecosystem.</p><h2 id=keynote-interview-decoding-quantum-computing-and-the-future-of-ai>Keynote interview. Decoding quantum computing and the future of AI</h2><p><strong>Description</strong>: Michio Kaku is a globally renowned theoretical physicist and futurist, a bestselling author and a populariser of science. As an originator of string field theory, he carries on Einstein’s quest to unite the four fundamental forces of nature into a grand unified theory of everything. Mr Kaku will share insights into quantum computing, focusing on the future of AI and other new technologies.</p><p><img alt=keynote2 src=https://i.ibb.co/k3rgjwM/IMG20240228091449.jpg></p><h3 id=decoding-quantum-computing>Decoding Quantum Computing</h3><p>Dr. Kaku begins by elucidating the essence of quantum computing, describing it as the replication of nature&rsquo;s own intricate processes. Just as nature harnesses the power of quantum mechanics to perform complex computations effortlessly, quantum computers aim to emulate this phenomenon by leveraging the principles of superposition and entanglement.</p><h3 id=the-promise-of-quantum-computing>The Promise of Quantum Computing</h3><p>Quantum computing holds immense promise for revolutionizing various fields, including cryptography, drug discovery, and optimization problems that are currently intractable for classical computers. Dr. Kaku emphasizes the potential of quantum supremacy, where quantum computers surpass the capabilities of classical computers in solving certain tasks, marking a pivotal moment in technological advancement.</p><h3 id=the-intersection-with-artificial-intelligence>The Intersection with Artificial Intelligence</h3><p>As we delve into the intersection of quantum computing and artificial intelligence, Dr. Kaku paints a compelling picture of the synergies between these two transformative technologies. Quantum computing has the potential to supercharge AI algorithms, enabling them to process vast amounts of data and perform computations at unprecedented speeds. This convergence paves the way for AI systems with enhanced capabilities in data analysis, pattern recognition, and decision-making.</p><h3 id=challenges-and-opportunities>Challenges and Opportunities</h3><p>However, Dr. Kaku acknowledges the formidable challenges that accompany the development of quantum computing and its integration with AI. From overcoming the inherent fragility of quantum systems to addressing concerns about algorithmic biases in AI, navigating this uncharted territory requires collaboration across disciplines and a nuanced understanding of both quantum mechanics and machine learning.</p><h3 id=looking-ahead>Looking Ahead</h3><p>In closing, Dr. Kaku offers a glimpse into the future landscape shaped by quantum computing and AI. He envisions a world where intelligent machines, empowered by quantum technologies, collaborate with humans to tackle complex problems and unlock new frontiers of innovation. With careful stewardship and ethical considerations, this symbiotic relationship between humanity and technology holds the potential to redefine our understanding of intelligence and propel us towards a brighter future. The possibilities are limitless.</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg><span class=tag><a href=https://nuttaphat.com/tags/blog>blog</a></span></p></div></main></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=footer__content><span>&copy; 2024</span>
