On **18-Aug-2020**, Taiwan finally opened its first appointment for locally-made vaccine [MVC COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MVC_COVID-19_vaccine). As this will be the very first rollout of the vaccine, there are still some doubts towards the safety of the vaccine. However, I am confident that the vaccine will be safe and effective; therefore I decided to register to receive my first dose on **23-Aug-2020**.

I will keep updating this log as I receive more information before and after receiving my first dose.
