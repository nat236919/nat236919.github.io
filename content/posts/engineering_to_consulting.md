In 2022, I faced a career crossroads when I received an offer to become a consultant in a private tech firm. While excited about the opportunity to try something new, I couldn't help but feel apprehensive about leaving behind my comfortable role as a software engineer. Ultimately, I took a leap of faith and accepted the offer, eager to see where this new path would take me.

However, my excitement quickly turned to reality when I realized that being a consultant requires a different skill set than what I had previously honed as an engineer. I quickly learned that strong interpersonal skills are a must, as consultants work closely with clients to understand their needs, provide guidance, and ensure successful project completion. Effective communication, both verbal and written, is critical, as is the ability to build and maintain strong client relationships. Additionally, consultants must have the ability to manage projects effectively, including developing project plans, tracking progress, and identifying and mitigating risks.

Despite initially feeling out of my depth, I have been fortunate to work alongside professional and competent colleagues who have helped me develop and improve my skills as a consultant. While the transition has been challenging, it has also been incredibly rewarding, and I am excited to see where this career path will take me in the future.
