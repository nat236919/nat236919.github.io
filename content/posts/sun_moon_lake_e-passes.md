Sun Moon Lake is one of the most famous attractions where most tourists who are in Taichung want to visit. Travelling there, of course, is well-known to be time-consuming; moreover, it can be costly. Therefore, several travelling packages are available for purchase at the HSR, TRA, Nantou Bus station, etc. which help save a lot of money. Generally, we would get paper tickets after purchasing.

Recently, in order to match up with an increasing number of mobile usage, The Nantou government has introduced e-Passes which can be purchased online. Save the time and save money!!

## How to purchase

1. Simply go to the [Nantou Bus website](https://ntbus.welcometw.com) and select the pass that you want (The website is currently supporting these languages: Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and English).

## Notes

Please be notified that you still need to get in line to redeem QR codes. However, by purchasing online, you will get QR codes which will be valid throughout the year (until December 31 of the year); moreover, it is cheaper, not a lot, but still. I hope this make your journey get smoother.
