## Introduction

This repository is a collection of data analysis projects focusing purely on expressing curiosity on a various topics ranging from science, maths, games, etc.

It generally consists three main parts:

- **Introduction** where a concept and questions are introduced
- **Experimental Procedures** where a script is written to prove the concept
- **Results** where statistical and visual results are presented

## Inspiration

As we have entered the information era, the Internet is full of endless information scattered all over the place. We receive new information every single second spent on the Internet, yet it might be not accurate or even nearly true.

Therefore, I have decided to take some interesting theories, myths, games, etc. into programming perspective and spice them up with my own silliness in an attempt of bringing them to light.

I hope you will enjoy exploring each one of them as I do. Cheers.
