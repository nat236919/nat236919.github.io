It serves as a summary reference for lesson observation discussions and teacher self-improvement. Assist teachers' professional growth through AI technology.
It has collected tens of thousands of excellent teaching plans and teaching examples, established the AI Smarter School exclusive channel, and provided a teacher professional development platform for the global smart teachers to watch, discuss and communicate with the public, to promote the spread of smarter education and accelerate the teacher professional development.</description></item><item><title>Daylify</title><link>https://nuttaphat.com/projects/2021/11/daylify/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 09:28:06 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://nuttaphat.com/projects/2021/11/daylify/</guid><description>Introduction Daylify is an experimental web application that allows users to record their moods on a daily basis.
Inspiration I wanted to create an easy-to-use web application to practice my skills. Furthermore, I would like to evaluate myself to see how I grow as a person, and to examine the highlights of my journey.
This project uses Vue.js for the UI, and FastAPI for the API which are hosted separately.</description></item><item><title>COVID-19 Vaccination Log</title><link>https://nuttaphat.com/posts/2021/08/covid-19-vaccination-log/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Aug 2021 09:10:28 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://nuttaphat.com/posts/2021/08/covid-19-vaccination-log/</guid><description>On 18-Aug-2020, Taiwan finally opened its first appointment for locally-made vaccine MVC COVID-19. As this will be the very first rollout of the vaccine, there are still some doubts towards the safety of the vaccine. However, I am confident that the vaccine will be safe and effective; therefore I decided to register to receive my first dose on 23-Aug-2020.
I will keep updating this log as I receive more information before and after receiving my doses.</description></item><item><title>GitHub Copilot</title><link>https://nuttaphat.com/posts/2021/08/github-copilot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 17:12:07 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://nuttaphat.com/posts/2021/08/github-copilot/</guid><description>What is GitHub Copilot? GitHub-Copilot is basically a smart code autocomplete powered by Codex, the new AI system created by OpenAI. GitHub Copilot understands significantly more context than most code assistants. So, whether it&amp;rsquo;s in a docstring, comment, function name, or the code itself, GitHub Copilot uses the context you&amp;rsquo;ve provided and synthesizes code to match.
I received an invitation to test out GitHub Copilot during its technical preview a couple of weeks ago, and I have been using it on Visual Studio Code ever since.</description></item><item><title>Introducing FastAPI</title><link>https://nuttaphat.com/posts/2021/06/introducing-fastapi/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 14:36:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://nuttaphat.com/posts/2021/06/introducing-fastapi/</guid><description>Introduction Developing APIs can be painful if we don&amp;rsquo;t know where to start. As I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a fan of Python, it is my first choice for development. It has a great number of frameworks and libraries supporting web development (e.g., Django, Flask, etc.). This time I would like to introduce a super-fast and easy-to-use framework which I&amp;rsquo;ve been using for a couple of years now: FastAPI.
FastAPI FastAPI is a high-performace web framework for creating APIs with Python.</description></item><item><title>Unconventional Russian Roulette</title><link>https://nuttaphat.com/posts/2020/11/unconventional-russian-roulette/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Nov 2020 12:57:57 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://nuttaphat.com/posts/2020/11/unconventional-russian-roulette/</guid><description>Source Code
What is Unconventional Russian Roulette? Unconventional Russian Roulette introduces similarities as its origin Russian Roulette. The difference is that instead of using one bullet, it uses three bullets where they are loaded adjacently.
Let&amp;rsquo;s imagine this scenario:
Three bullets are loaded into the cylinder adjacently, Player A has taken a shot and survived. We, as Player B, need to decide whether to take a shot or not. For the sake of simplicity, the game ends this round and here are the conditions:</description></item><item><title>Scavenger</title><link>https://nuttaphat.com/projects/2020/11/scavenger/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Nov 2020 13:45:41 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://nuttaphat.com/projects/2020/11/scavenger/</guid><description>Introduction Scavenger is an experimental web scraping project as a service that simply offers an easy-to-use functionality to scrap a website and gather a specific piece of information as needed.
Features Web Scraping: It gets its hands dirty going out to endless space of World Wide Web to make sure that you get what you need Processing: Gliding through a scraped website to seek a piece of information as required Presenting: It manages and presents the result beautifully to make it easier to comprehend Inspiration One of the core ideas on developing this project was that I wanted to create a web app application and deliver it within tight schedules.</description></item><item><title>Curiosity Jar</title><link>https://nuttaphat.com/projects/2020/09/curiosity-jar/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Sep 2020 15:54:45 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://nuttaphat.com/projects/2020/09/curiosity-jar/</guid><description>Introduction This repository is a collection of data analysis projects focusing purely on expressing curiosity on a various topics ranging from science, maths, games, etc.
It generally consists three main parts:
Introduction where a concept and questions are introduced Experimental Procedures where a script is written to prove the concept Results where statistical and visual results are presented Inspiration As we have entered the information era, the Internet is full of endless information scattered all over the place.</description></item><item><title>The Humble-Nishiyama Randomness Game</title><link>https://nuttaphat.com/posts/2020/09/the-humble-nishiyama-randomness-game/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Sep 2020 16:58:48 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://nuttaphat.com/posts/2020/09/the-humble-nishiyama-randomness-game/</guid><description>Source Code
What is The Humble-Nishiyama Randomness Game? The Humble-Nishiyama Randomness Game is a game invented by two mathematicians: Steve Humble and Yutaka Nishiyama. It is a game that seems fair at the first glance, yet has a way to increase a chance of winning significantly.
The game is based on the idea of Penney Ante game in which 2 players select their own sequential outcomes (n = 3) of a coin toss (either HEADS or TAILS).</description></item><item><title>When Null is An Object</title><link>https://nuttaphat.com/posts/2020/09/when-null-is-an-object/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Sep 2020 09:50:26 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://nuttaphat.com/posts/2020/09/when-null-is-an-object/</guid><description>JavaScript is weird; that is all I can say about it. If I were asked to compare JS with an animal, it would definitely be a cat. Despite its overloaded cuteness, it always seems that it is plotting against you. However, at the end of the day, we still love them.
The fun started when I was working on a function that returns an object. The object was meant to be used for displaying data on a webpage.</description></item></channel></rss>
