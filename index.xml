      <description>Sun Moon Lake is one of the most famous attractions where most tourists who are in Taichung want to visit. Travelling there, of course, is well-known to be time-consuming; moreover, it can be costly.

Recently, in order to match up with an increasing number of mobile usage, The Nantou government has introduced e-Passes which can be purchased online.</description>
