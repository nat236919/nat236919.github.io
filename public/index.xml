      <description>JavaScript is weird; that is all I can say about it. If I were asked to compare JS with an animal, it would definitely be a cat. Despite its overloaded cuteness, it always seems that it is plotting against you. However, at the end of the day, we still love them.
The fun started when I was working on a function that returns an object. The object was meant to be used for displaying data on a webpage.</description>

      <description>Recently, I have been tasked to maintain one of the projects that provide a video player service powered by a powerful library videojs which claims to be the most popular open-source HTML5 player framework, according to its site.
The previous engineers working before me had contributed a tremendous work by creating a customised version of our own player which provides functionalities, such as time markers, etc. It worked perfectly. Until I was asked to implement three new functionalities onto the video player:</description>

      <description>Sun Moon Lake is one of the most famous attractions where most tourists who are in Taichung want to visit. Travelling there, of course, is well-known to be time-consuming; moreover, it can be costly. Therefore, several travelling packages are available for purchase at the HSR, TRA, Nantou Bus station, etc. which help save a lot of money. Generally, we would get paper tickets after purchasing.
Recently, in order to match up with an increasing number of mobile usage, The Nantou government has introduced e-Passes which can be purchased online.</description>
